# Configuration Toggle Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented configuration toggles in the volatility fitting system to allow users to enable/disable wing models through YAML configuration. This provides fine-grained control over which models are executed during volatility surface calibration.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Configuration Structure (`config/volatility_config.yaml`)
Added the `enabled_models` section under `models`:
```yaml
models:
  enabled_models:
    wing_model: true              # Enable/disable Traditional Wing Model
    time_adjusted_wing_model: true # Enable/disable Time-Adjusted Wing Model
```

### 2. Configuration Loader Methods (`config/config_loader.py`)
Enhanced the `Config` class with new methods:
- `is_model_enabled(model_name)`: Check if a specific model is enabled
- `wing_model_enabled` (property): Quick check for Traditional Wing Model
- `time_adjusted_wing_model_enabled` (property): Quick check for Time-Adjusted Wing Model  
- `get_enabled_models()`: Get list of all enabled model names

### 3. Notebook Integration (`notebooks/volatility_fitting.ipynb`)
Updated all model calibration sections to respect configuration toggles:

#### Traditional Wing Model Section:
- Added configuration check before creating calibrator
- Conditional execution with informative status messages
- Graceful handling when model is disabled

#### Time-Adjusted Wing Model Section:
- Added configuration check before creating calibrator
- Conditional execution with informative status messages
- Graceful handling when model is disabled

#### Multi-Start Calibration Sections:
- Both Traditional Wing and Time-Adjusted Wing multi-start sections now check configuration
- Skip multi-start calibration if base model is disabled
- Clear status messages about why calibration is skipped

#### Error Standardization:
- Unified use of `result.error` throughout notebook instead of mixed RMSE calculations
- Consistent error reporting and threshold checking

## Usage Examples

### Check Model Status
```python
from config.config_loader import load_volatility_config

vol_config = load_volatility_config()

# Check individual models
if vol_config.wing_model_enabled:
    print("Traditional Wing Model is enabled")
    
if vol_config.time_adjusted_wing_model_enabled:
    print("Time-Adjusted Wing Model is enabled")

# Get all enabled models
enabled_models = vol_config.get_enabled_models()
print(f"Enabled models: {enabled_models}")
```

### Conditional Model Execution in Notebook
```python
# Traditional Wing Model - Configuration-Aware
if vol_config.wing_model_enabled:
    print("✅ Traditional Wing Model: ENABLED")
    # ... calibration code ...
else:
    print("⚠️ Traditional Wing Model: DISABLED in configuration")
    print("   Skipping Traditional Wing Model calibration")
    wing_result = None
```

### Enable/Disable Models
Edit `config/volatility_config.yaml`:
```yaml
models:
  enabled_models:
    wing_model: false             # Disable Traditional Wing Model
    time_adjusted_wing_model: true # Enable Time-Adjusted Wing Model
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexible Model Selection**: Users can run only the models they need
2. **Faster Development**: Skip expensive calibrations during testing/development
3. **Resource Management**: Reduce computational load by disabling unnecessary models
4. **Clean Configuration**: Centralized control through YAML configuration
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Notebook continues to run with informative messages when models are disabled
6. **Consistent Interface**: Standardized approach for future model additions

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Both models enabled: Normal operation with all calibrations
- ✅ Traditional Wing disabled: Skips Traditional Wing calibration, continues with Time-Adjusted Wing
- ✅ Time-Adjusted Wing disabled: Skips Time-Adjusted Wing calibration, continues with Traditional Wing
- ✅ Configuration loading: Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Multi-start calibration: Respects model enable/disable settings
- ✅ Error standardization: Consistent use of result.error throughout notebook

## Files Modified

1. `config/volatility_config.yaml` - Added enabled_models section
2. `config/config_loader.py` - Added model enablement methods
3. `notebooks/volatility_fitting.ipynb` - Updated all model calibration sections
4. `example_config_usage.py` - Example demonstrating configuration usage

The implementation provides a clean, intuitive way to control model execution through configuration while maintaining full backward compatibility and clear user feedback.
